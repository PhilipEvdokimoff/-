Dear Denise,

Thank you so much for your last letter. Its always great to hear from you!

Im sorry to know that youre not feeling very heathy and I really want to help you with some advice. I think the best forms of exercise to start getting fit are sit ups, push ups and abdominal crunches, because theyre very simple but effective. Answering your second question, I think you should exercise every morning, because its important to exercise regularly to keep fit. Although Ive never worked out in the gym or fitness club, I think its a good idea, because youll get all the needed training facility and you also will be able to work out with a personal fitness trainer.

Anyway, I must go and get on with my studies. Write back soon!

All the best,

Philip


  words (I cant make less: Ive removed all that and other clarifications and used short verb forms everywhere I could, but my letter still being too long)

Also Im not sure about abdominal crunches, bc I dont know how to correctly and simply say  in English. I could remove it from my letter to make it shorter, but I really find this exercise important for Denise.
